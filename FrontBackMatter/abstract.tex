\par The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources has created programs to promote the installation of renewable thermal systems in buildings in order to decrease the Commonwealthâ€™s dependence on nonrenewable resources, which are unsustainable and harmful to the environment and public health. The goal of this project was to support the DOER by evaluating three renewable thermal projects to improve and promote the installation of renewable thermal systems. We gathered information on the project processes and compiled it into informational case studies for each site. It is our hope that these case studies will lead to the implementation of more renewable thermal projects, each with more efficient implementations.
