\par The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources has created programs to promote the installation of renewable thermal systems in buildings in order to decrease the Commonwealthâ€™s dependence on nonrenewable resources. The goal of this project was to support the DOER by evaluating three renewable thermal projects, including an air source heat pump and two biomass systems, to improve and promote the installation of renewable thermal systems. Through interviews and site visits, we gathered and compiled information on the project processes into informational case studies for each site. It is our hope that these case studies will lead to the implementation of more renewable thermal projects, each with more efficient implementations.
